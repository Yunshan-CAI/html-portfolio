<h1>The Best Movies According to Alicia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<h3>Taxi Driver</h3>
<pr>The actor is hopelessly lonely and I think I can sympathize with that.</pr>
<h3>El viaje</h3>
<pr>It's a fucking beautiful movie. Magical. Unexpected. It is a lot of things.</pr>
<h3>The World to Come</h3>
<pr>A glommy queer movie with a devastatingly loving couple. How I love the literariness of the movie!</pr>
